## Description Of My Portfolio Website
### Purpose
The portfolio website serves as a starting point for my software development journey.
This website is a basic site about me and what I could offer to potential employers.

### Functionality / features
I have implemented a few feautures since it is a static website. The website itself is
functional enough to browse through. A few features include; *navigation bar*, *social buttons*, *hyperlinks* etc.
