            <h3 id="ph">Personality</h3>
            <img id="p1" src="./docs/personality.png">
        <p>If I was to describe my personality in one word, it would be "driven". However, one word wouldn't be enough to
            describe me. I have a great work ethic, I'm patient, resilient and composed when it comes to putting in the work.
            Now obvioulsy this would sound like a brag but I'm also humble enough to admit that it wasn't easy to become the 
            person I am. It took a lot of work to build who I am and I can say my resilience played a huge role in this. I can 
            say with confidence that I have the perfect personality for this career. I like solving problems and this is an essential
            drive to succeed in this career.
